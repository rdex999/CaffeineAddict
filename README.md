# CaffeineAddict
Caffeine Addict is a 2D game about a person who is addicted to caffeine, and also needs to kill zombies to survive. 

Wrriten in C with sdl2.

Please note that this is my first ever project in C, so i know the code kinda sucks.
I also made this game about a year ago and now i decided to put it in github.

## How to run the game
### For Linux:
in the folder "CaffeineAddict-Linux" there is a binary file named "main"  
just give it an execution premission and launch it
```
chmod +x main
```
```
./main
```
### For Windows:
in the folder "CaffeineAddict-Windows" there is a "main.exe" file, just launch that.
